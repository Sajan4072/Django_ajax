1...after creating a user model to see if its working properly or not you can 
create super user and go in admmin panel and see or you can use tools such as sqllite viewer


2..to be able to see model users in admin panel you should register that model in admin.py
from .models import user
@admin.register(User)
....
...
etc

3.using the models, we can create modelforms(in forms.py)that can be rendered and shown to user

4....if we need bootstrap wala form we need to set widgets add classes etc (CK)
??


5..since our model form is ready we need to render it in views

6.. so create template/home.hmtl for displaying 
7.. write the view since we need blank form so 
form=StudentRegistration()  //creating an object 
{'form':form} this is context

8.in html, inside body inside form tag csrf and {form.as_p}

9..styling the form with bootstrap by linking in head 

10. create a div with class (and bootstrap such as mt-5,text-center,alert alert-danger etc can be given inside class itself)

11...form ko fields ma widgets ko through dekhi classes lagaunu parcha 
i.e in forms.py
